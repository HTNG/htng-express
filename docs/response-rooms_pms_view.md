### Example response generated by a PMS system utilising the ExpressPMS specification
```yaml
[
  {
    "room_number": "000",
    "room_type_code": "CONF",
    "maid_id": "0",
    "status_service_requested": "MAKE_UP_ROOM",
    "is_inventoried": true,
    "status_front_office_occupancy": "VACANT",
    "status_housekeeping_occupancy": "VACANT",
    "status_housekeeping_cleaning": "DIRTY",
    "status_inventory": "NONE"
  }
]
```
As can be seen from the above, this is an array of objects that are returned encapsulating the data received from the PMS.

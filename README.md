<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

For hotels, currently the PMS serves as the primary interface for guests, reservations, folio and room data. Because of this, any system that interacts with any of these entities requires an integration to be effective. However, not all integrations are created equal. Integrations that require only a subset of the functionality of the PMS go through the same process as distribution channels. Early integration standards with HTNG were focused on distributing room inventory, connecting a PMS with OTAs, CRS, GDS, website, CRM, etc.

The process of systems integrations in hotels is generally lengthy and complex. This is especially true for integrations with the PMS systems, which have the highest demand due to their importance.

For the vendor: 1) Projects take longer and are less predictable, resulting in delayed revenue; 2) A lot of rework needs to happen when specifications are wrong; and 3) New integrations take time to write which results in a waste of internal resources.

For the hotels: 1) Projects get delayed; 2) PMs and other relationship managers sit in the middle of a PMS/vendor; and 3) Lots of interactions create friction in the hotel-PMS and hotel-vendor relationship.

For the PMS: 1) The amount of integrations that happen each year are lower, resulting in delayed revenue; and 2) Unnecessary resources are used to manage the bespoke process.

HTNG's Express PMS Integrations Workgroup is focused on creating standards for integrations with PMS systems that require a limited data set, allowing for a much quicker and less resource intensive integration. There are two tracks running simultaneously, one for the creation of the specifications (APIs) and one for creating a more standardized process for integration with various PMS systems.

The specifications track has defined the data fields for three messages: 1) Reservation, 2) Room and 3) Folio. HTNG's Express PMS Workgroup is currently working on the services for each of these messages to create a common process for requesting integrations with PMS providers. This output will be especially helpful for those integrating with multiple PMS providers.`
